# ECS Overview and Introduction

## What is ECS?
The Entity Component System (ECS) is a design pattern that decouples game logic into three fundamental parts:

1. **Entity:** A unique identifier representing an object in the game world.
2. **Component:** A container for data that defines the state or behavior of an entity.
3. **System:** Logic that processes entities possessing specific components.

This separation of concerns ensures modularity, flexibility, and performance.

## Why Use ECS?
ECS is favored for game development due to:

- **Modularity:** Adding new functionality becomes straightforward without affecting existing systems.
- **Performance:** Efficiently processes large numbers of entities.
- **Flexibility:** Systems can operate independently, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.

## ECS in R-Type
In the R-Type project, ECS facilitates:

- Clear separation of data (components) and logic (systems).
- Efficient management of entities like players, enemies, and projectiles.
- Scalable design for adding new features or mechanics.

### High-Level Workflow
1. Entities are created in the `Registry`.
2. Components are attached to entities to define their state.
3. Systems operate on entities with specific components, updating their state or triggering events.
