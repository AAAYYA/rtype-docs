## Introduction to the R-Type Game Project

### Overview:
R-Type is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up game where players control a spaceship to defeat waves of enemies, avoid obstacles, and collect power-ups. This project utilizes an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture for efficient game logic management.

### Key Features:
- **Entity Component System (ECS):**
  - Decouples data (components) from logic (systems).
  - Provides flexibility for adding new features and optimizing performance.
- **Multiplayer Support:**
  - Includes a network module (`GameNetwork`) for player communication and entity synchronization.
- **Interactive Power-Ups:**
  - Players can collect power-ups to enhance abilities.
- **Dynamic Rendering:**
  - Uses the Raylib library for rendering sprites and animations.
- **Modular Systems:**
  - Collision detection, enemy AI, input handling, and more are implemented as separate systems.

### Project Structure:
1. **Core Systems:**
   - `CollisionSystem`: Handles collision detection and resolution.
   - `EnemyShootingSystem`: Manages enemy projectile generation.
   - `InputSystem`: Processes player input for movement and shooting.
2. **Utilities:**
   - `GameCommon`: Utility functions for shared gameplay elements (e.g., health bars).
   - `GameSetup`: Initializes ECS components and game systems.
   - `GameNetwork`: Manages networking for multiplayer support.
3. **Components:**
   - Defines data structures like `Position`, `Health`, `Velocity`, and `EntityType`.
4. **Assets:**
   - Textures, sounds, and animations used in the game.

### Dependencies:
- **Raylib:** For graphics rendering.
- **ASIO:** For networking and asynchronous communication.
- **C++ STL:** Core language features and containers.

### Development Goals:
- Create a scalable and maintainable codebase for extending gameplay features.
- Ensure smooth multiplayer experience with synchronized game states.
- Provide modular and reusable systems for efficient development.

### How to Use This Documentation:
- Start with `GameSetup` to understand initialization.
- Refer to individual system documentation for implementation details.
- Use `GameCommon` and `GameNetwork` for utilities and multiplayer functions.
